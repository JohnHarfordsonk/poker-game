That is a poker game made in C language 

<h2>How is this code used?</h2>

This code is a program for a poker game. It shuffles a deck of cards, deals two hands of two cards each, and then deals five community cards (the "flop," "turn," and "river") that both players can use to make their best hand. The program then evaluates each player's hand and determines a winner based on hand rankings and tiebreakers.

<h2>What libraries are used in this program?</h2>

This program uses several standard C libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, and time.h. These libraries provide functions for input/output, memory management, string manipulation, and time measurement.

<h2>How can a user use this program?</h2>

The user can compile the program and run it from the command line. The program will then run the poker game and output the results, including the hands dealt, the community cards, and the winning player.
